<mark><h1><big><big>There was once a woodcutter, working hard in the forest, getting wood to sell for some food. As he was cutting a tree,<br> his axe accidentally fell into the river. The river was deep and was flowing really fast – he lost his axe and could not find it again.<br> He sat at the bank of the river and wept.

While he wept, the God of the river arose and asked him what happened.<br> The woodcutter told him the story.<br> The God of the river offered to help him by looking for his axe.<br> He disappeared into the river and retrieved a golden axe, but the woodcutter said it was not his.<br> He disappeared again and came back with a silver axe, but the woodcutter said that was not his either.<br> The God disappeared into the water again and came back with an iron axe – the woodcutter smiled and said it was his.<br> The God was impressed with the woodcutter’s honesty and gifted him both the golden and silver axes.<br>

Moral of the Story=
Honesty is the best policy.</h1></big></mark></big>
