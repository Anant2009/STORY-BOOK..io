<center><big><big>One day, king Akbar asked a question in his court that left everyone in the courtroom puzzled.<br> As they all tried to figure out the answer, Birbal walked in and asked what the matter was.<br> They repeated the question to him.The question was, “How many crows are there in the city?”<br>

Birbal immediately smiled and went up to Akbar. He announced the answer; he said there were twenty-one thousand, <Br>five hundred and twenty-three crows in the city. When asked how he knew the answer, Birbal replied,<br> “Ask your men to count the number of crows. If there are more, then the relatives of the crows must be visiting them from nearby cities. <br>If there are fewer, then the crows from our city must be visiting their relatives who live outside the city.” Pleased with the answer,<br> Akbar presented Birbal with a ruby and pearl chain.<br>
Moral of the Story<br>
